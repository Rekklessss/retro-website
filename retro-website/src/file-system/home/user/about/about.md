# Hi there

My name is Divyanshu Pabia and I am a final year student completing his Bachelors of Technology, majoring in Computer Science at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I have a passion for all things technology and perfectionism, from software engineering & machine learning to web3, blockchain and app development.

In addition to my love of technology and innovation, I am also interested in f1, trading, travelling and swimming.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of projects I have developed over my four plus years of coding experience.
